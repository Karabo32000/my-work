    <h1> LA COSA NOSTRA </h1>

The La Cosa Nostra, also known in the English language as "This thing of ours" is the Italian Mafia. The La Cosa Nostra
began in Sicily, an island in the South of Italy. The Mafia later expanded to America and was found mainly in New York pioneered 
likes of Lucky Luciano, Carlo Gambino and Giuseppe Masseria. The mob ran successfully despite the efforts of law enforcement
until the organisation forced the hand of law enforcement when it turned the city into a blood bath in the 70-90s and inflitrating 
the construction industry and other government funded industries.
</br>

In the 80s in New York City, the mob had complete control over the unions, this meant that crime organisation had almost
complete control over legitimate business in the city resulting in the city losing millions to the crime organisation every year. 
It seemed as though, the mob was unstoppable until one tool helped Law enforcement win back the city in the 90s and 
that tool was what we know to day as... THE RICO LAW.
